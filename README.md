## Beam Propagation and Fourier Optics
This repository contains all my projects in the field of Beam Prop and Fourier optics

# Anisotropic Media
The report is available and describes the variation of polarization of different EM waves through a twisted nematic liquid crystal cell. 
The matlab code used is provided.

# Fourier Optics
Launch the matlab code LOUIS.m to see a digital Hologram construction.

# Geometrical Optics
The report is available and describes the variation of image position of a beam trhough a sphere of specific refractive index in the context of geometrical optics.
The matlab code used is provided.

# Wave polarization
The report is available and describes the variation of reflected EM wave polarization and Energy for different input polarization and complex refractive index at the interface.
The matlab code used is provided.

Happy reading :)
